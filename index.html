        English is an Indo-European language and belongs to the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages.[16] Old
        English originated from a Germanic tribal and linguistic continuum along the Frisian North Sea coast, whose
        languages gradually evolved into the Anglic languages in the British Isles, and into the Frisian languages and
        Low German/Low Saxon on the continent. The Frisian languages, which together with the Anglic languages form the
        Anglo-Frisian languages, are the closest living relatives of English. Low German/Low Saxon is also closely
        related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the North Sea
        Germanic languages, though this grouping remains debated.[13] Old English evolved into Middle English, which in
        turn evolved into Modern English.[17] Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number
        of other Anglic languages, including Scots[18] and the extinct Fingallian dialect and Yola language of
        Ireland.[19]
